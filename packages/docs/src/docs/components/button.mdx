Buttons are simple controls for executing specific on-page actions and code. Buttons are most commonly used in forms, dialogs, and modals to facilitate required user actions.

## Usage

- **Do** make sure the label conveys a clear purpose of the button to the user.
- **Do not** use generic labels like "Ok," especially in the case of an error; errors are never "Ok."

## Variations

```jsx
<Stack direction="row">
  <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
</Stack>
```
