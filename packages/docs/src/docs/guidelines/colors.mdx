## Overview

Benchmark provides a base set of colors from which everything is built upon.

- Consitancy
- Easy to update
- Design tokens
- CSS variables
  - Colors are not hard coded
- AAA WCAG

### Semantec Naming

All colors semantic. Their semantic name is static and does not change over time. This provides the following benefits:

1. Intent. The name of the color provides a clear understanding of the colors intended purpose. A color with name of color-warning makes is clear that the color is to convey a "warning" to the student.

2. Shared Language. It is much easier to communicate within and between teams using semantic names. Communicating with color values or off the cuff references is confusing and inconsistent.

3. Maintainability. A semantic name such as primary-color is agnostic of the color it is bound to. Today the primary-color is blue but we can change this to green tomorrow.

4. Theming. Semantic names makes theming easy. One themes `primary-color` is a light blue while a color blind accessible theme may set it to a dark orange.

## Colors

### Main Colors

There are..
<ColorSwatch name="Primary" color="primary" />
<ColorSwatch name="Secondary" color="secondary" />

### Neutrals

A range of neutral colors are available. These colors play a supporting role in building out the UI.

The scale ranges from 0 (white) to 1000 (black). Each step in color increases the lightness by 10%. By default these neutral colors are on a grey scale but that may be set to another tone in other themes.

To ensure that the UI is accessbile and maintains a high level of contrast the scale does not include colors in the middle of the range (400 to 600).

For the dark theme the scale is reversed where 0 is black and 1000 is black.

<div>
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 0" color="n.0" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 100" color="n.100" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 200" color="n.200" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 300" color="n.300" />
</div>
<div>
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 700" color="n.700" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 800" color="n.800" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 900" color="n.900" />
  <ColorSwatch name="Neutral 1000" color="n.1000" border />
</div>

### Feedback

A set of colors available to help convey feedback to the student. Feedback is typically a result of an action they have just performed and is most often used within forms, modal dialogs and alerts.

Color alone is not enough to convey meaning for students that are color blind. These colors should be used in a complimentary manner with other viual cues such as an icon.

<ColorSwatch name="Info" color="info" />
<ColorSwatch name="Success" color="success" />
<ColorSwatch name="Warning" color="warning" />
<ColorSwatch name="Danger" color="danger" />
